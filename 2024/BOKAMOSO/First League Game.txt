It`s Bk and i`m back with another update

So far nothing much has happened just a few good training sessions but tomorrow i`m finally playing the first league game of the season. It is against West Rand Ballers who had previously beaten us 6-4 in a friendly game we had a while back. This time around though things will be different as we are now stronger and are a unit. I will let you guys know about the score next time we meet and let`s hope we will come back with a positive result.
